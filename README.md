# Auto-Complete-Tree

A prefix tree to enhance text auto-complete functionality. This data structure efficiently stores and retrieves words based on prefixes, making it suitable for predictive text features like those in mobile keyboards.

Tree Structure:

Node Representation: Each node represents a character in a word. Nodes are connected via a Map where keys are characters and values are child nodes.
Word End Indicator: Each node has a boolean flag to indicate if it marks the end of a word.

**Key Learnings:**

* Data Structure Implementation: Hands-on experience with implementing a trie, a foundational data structure for text processing.
* Efficient Lookup: Understanding how prefix trees facilitate fast lookups and auto-completion by leveraging character-based node structures.
* Recursive Traversal: Gained insight into using recursive methods for tree traversal to collect words based on prefixes.
